# Pilot Partner Engagement Kit (Phase 0 Task 4)

Use this file to organize outreach, agreements, and artefacts from conveyancers, municipalities, developer partners, and payment providers. Fill out each section as you make progress; it doubles as a checklist for the non-technical founder.

---

## 1. Target Partner List

| Partner Type | Candidate | Contact Owner | Status | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Conveyancer |  |  | Not started |  |
| Conveyancer |  |  |  |  |
| Municipality |  |  |  |  |
| Municipality |  |  |  |  |
| Developer (Fractional Pilot) |  |  |  |  |
| Stablecoin/Bank Partner |  |  |  |  |

**Action:** Populate the table with names, roles, and meeting dates as soon as outreach begins.

---

## 2. Pilot MoU / Letter of Intent Outline
Include these sections when drafting lightweight agreements (adapt with legal counsel):
1. **Objective:** Define joint goal (digitize transfers, run fractional pilot, etc.).
2. **Scope:** Describe processes covered (OTP, KYC, escrow, certificates, registration).
3. **Responsibilities:**  
   - *EquiXToken Capital:* Provide platform, support, training, compliance guardrails.  
   - *Partner:* Supply templates, assign point of contact, share feedback, ensure data privacy compliance.  
4. **Data Handling:** Clarify PII protection, encryption, restricted access, and storage duration.
5. **Timeline & Milestones:** Phase 0 dates, go-live expectations, review checkpoints.
6. **Success Metrics:** Define how to measure pilot success (time saved, accuracy, user satisfaction).
7. **Confidentiality & IP:** Mutual NDA clauses, ownership of insights.
8. **Exit & Escalation:** Early termination rights, escalation path for issues.

Document final agreements in your secure drive and note references in the log table below.

## 3. Artefact Collection Tracker

| Item | Source | Storage Location | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|------------------|--------|-------|
| OTP template (developer sale) | Conveyancer |  | Not started |  |
| OTP template (private sale) |  |  |  |  |
| Municipal rates clearance checklist | Municipality |  |  |  |
| Transfer duty receipt workflow |  |  |  |  |
| Deeds registration pack |  |  |  |  |
| Guardian/ESG metrics definitions | Developer |  |  |  |

Add additional items as partners provide materials. Store actual documents securely (not in repo) and reference the location (e.g., SharePoint, encrypted drive).

---

## 4. Meeting Agenda Template
Use this structure for discovery calls with partners:
1. **Introductions & Pilot Goal (5 min)**
2. **Current Process Walkthrough (15 min)**
3. **Pain Points & Bottlenecks (10 min)**
4. **Data & Document Requirements (10 min)**
5. **Compliance & Security Expectations (10 min)**
6. **Pilot Timeline & Success Metrics (5 min)**
7. **Next Steps & Deliverables (5 min)**

- Kickoff email summarizing goals and deliverables (template below).
- Weekly check-in (email or call) to review progress, blockers, and feedback.
- Monthly summary deck with metrics and upcoming milestones.

Subject: EquiXToken Capital Pilot Kickoff & Next Steps

Hi <Name>,

Thank you for partnering with us on the EquiXToken Capital pilot. Our shared objective is to digitize the OTP → Registration journey and prepare for fractional investment enablement.

Key pilot milestones:
- Week 1: Share OTP templates, municipal checklists, and key contacts.
- Week 2: Validate workflow prototype and confirm compliance requirements.
- Week X: Begin end-to-end pilot cases with support from our team.

What we need from you:
1. Confirm the documents attached are current.
2. Introduce the operational lead we’ll collaborate with daily.
3. Share any mandatory compliance or security policies we must follow.

We will send calendar invites for the weekly sync and provide access to the pilot status dashboard shortly.

Looking forward to working together!

Best,
<Your Name>
Founder, EquiXToken Capital
